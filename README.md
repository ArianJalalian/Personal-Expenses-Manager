# Personal Expenses Manager App 

-Implemented with Flutter and dart

-You can add your expenses during a week and a little chart will demonstrate how much money you have spent in each day 

Disclaimer : The idea of the project and the orginal code is not mine. I just coded along with a course taught by Maximilian Schwarzm√ºller on udemy, 
which you can find a link to it down below :
